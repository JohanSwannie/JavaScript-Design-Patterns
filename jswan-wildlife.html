Several colleagues there had been closely involved with creating the Plant Conservation Network website, and kept asking why there was no bird equivalent. My move to Te Papa in mid-2010 provided an opportunity to promote the idea, which was supported by Te Papa’s Natural Environment team. With the backing of the Council of Birds New Zealand, a joint application was made to the Terrestrial and Freshwater Biodiversity Information Systems (TFBIS) fund, and the website name ‘New Zealand Birds Online’ was selected.

              We are pushing our planet to the brink. Human activity—how we feed, fuel, and finance our lives—is taking an unprecedented toll on wildlife, wild places, and the natural resources we need to survive.

              On average, we’ve seen an astonishing 60% decline in the size of populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians in just over 40 years, according to WWF’s Living Planet Report 2018. The top threats to species identified
              in the report link directly to human activities, including habitat loss and degradation and the excessive use of wildlife such as overfishing and overhunting.

              The report presents a sobering picture of the impact human activity has on the world’s wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers, and climate. We’re facing a rapidly closing window for action and the urgent need for everyone—everyone—to
              collectively rethink and redefine how we value, protect, and restore nature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="more__information">
            <p>
              “This report sounds a warning shot across our bow,” said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of WWF-US. “Natural systems essential to our survival—forests, oceans, and rivers—remain in decline. Wildlife around the world continue to
              dwindle. It reminds us we need to change course. It’s time to balance our consumption with the needs of nature, and to protect the only planet that is our home.”
              To ensure a sustainable future for all living things, we need to urgently curb the loss of nature. The biggest challenge—and biggest opportunity—lies in changing our approach to development and remember that protecting nature also helps
              protect people.

              WWF is working with governments, businesses, and communities to reduce carbon emissions, prevent habitat loss, and advance policies to fight climate change. We’re focused on protecting wildlife and conserving natural resources like
              forests, oceans, fresh water, and grasslands. And we’re exploring new ways to feed our population without hurting the environment.

              Ultimately, the world needs to come together to make a global deal to save nature.

  <!-- Setting up more in depth detail in this section about the Tui Bird in New Zealand -->

  <section id="card1__info" class="container-fluid">
    <article class="row col-xl-12 wildlife the_tui">
      <h1>Tui Bird - New Zealand</h1>
      <p class="wildlife_detail">
        <b>Identification</b><br><br>

        Tui have almost-black heads, underparts, wings and tails that have an iridescent blue and green sheen,
        especially on the head and wings. The upper back and flanks are dark reddish brown with a bronze sheen,
        the nape and sides of the neck have filamentous white feathers, and there are two unusual curled white
        feather tufts on the throat (poi). Small white shoulder patches on the upperwing show prominently in
        flight, but are usually concealed when perched. The bill and feet are black, and the eye dark brown.
        The sexes are alike, but the male is larger. Adults have a notch on the 8th primary, and this feather
        quivers from the narrow part creating the whirring sound in flight. At first, juveniles have a browner
        body and lack the throat tuft, but after a few months they are only distinguishable in the hand from
        the lack of notch on the 8th primary.

        Voice: a loud and complicated mix of tuneful notes interspersed with coughs, grunts and wheezes. In
        flight, tui maintain contact and harass raptors with a repetitive scream.

        Similar species: male blackbirds are uniformly black, lack throat tufts, and have an orange bill.
        Bellbirds have very similar song, but this is more fluid, and lacks the loud coughs, grunts and
        wheezes of tui.

        <br><br><b>Distribution and habitat</b><br><br>

        Tui are widespread and locally abundant on the North, South and Stewart Islands, and their offshore
        islands; they are scarce only in drier, largely open country east of the Southern Alps. Tui are present
        on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, and there is a larger subspecies endemic to the Chatham Islands.
        Tui are absent on the Poor Knights Islands probably due to the very high density of bellbirds there
        competing for a limited nectar resource. Tui are found in native forest and scrub (sometimes in exotic
        forests), and in rural gardens, stands of flowering kowhai and gums, and in suburban parks and gardens.
        There is much local movement, when tui follow a seasonal succession of flowering or fruiting plants.
        They usually nest in native forest and scrub, but will commute more than 10 km daily to feed on rich
        sources of nectar.

        <br><br><b>Population</b><br><br>

        Tui are locally abundant on the mainland and on some offshore islands, especially where there is a
        concentration of flowering plants or fruiting trees (e.g. flowering kowhai, fuchsia, flax, rata or
        gums; or fruiting kahikatea) and generally in higher numbers in areas where there has been pest
        (possum and predator) control. They are common on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, but are scarce
        on the main Chatham Island (they are more common in the southern Chatham Islands).

        <br><br><b>Threats and conservation</b><br><br>

        Tui were the most common passerine found in Maori middens and were probably once an important source of
        protein. Despite the loss of the vast majority of lowland forest in New Zealand, tui have probably
        benefitted from the introduction to New Zealand of a variety of flowering and fruiting plants. These new
        species, as well as ‘out-of-range’ plantings of native species and sugar-water feeders in gardens, now
        provide tui with a reliable year-round supply of nectar and fruit. Tui respond extremely well to pest
        control programmes targeting possums, rats and mustelids, which are probably their main nest predators.

        Recent attempts to reintroduce tui to Banks Peninsula, and Chatham Island tui to Chatham Island
        (from Rangatira Island), both in 2009-10, are showing encouraging signs of success.

        <br><br><b>Breeding</b><br><br>

        Eggs are laid from September to January. The nest, built by the female, is a rough bulky structure of twigs
        and sticks, lined with fine grasses, high in the canopy or subcanopy. The clutch is 2-4 white or pale pink
        eggs, marked with reddish-brown spots and blotches. Incubation and brooding is by the female only. Chicks
        are initially fed only by the female, but later the male helps to feed them.

        <br><br><b>Behaviour and ecology</b><br><br>

        Tui are notoriously aggressive, and will defend a flowering or fruiting tree, or a small part of a large tree,
        from all-comers, whether another tui or another bird species. They vigorously chase other birds away from their
        feeding territory with loud whirring wings. Tui have a display flight, in which they fly upwards above the canopy,
        and then make a noisy, near-vertical, dive back into the canopy. Tui play a very important role in the dynamics
        of New Zealand forests because they are one of the most common pollinators of flowering plants, and also disperse
        the seeds of trees with medium-sized fruits.

        <br><br><b>Food</b><br><br>

        Tui diet varies depending on the seasonal availability of nectar and fruits. Their preferred diet is nectar and
        honeydew, and they will often shift to, or commute daily or more frequently to, good nectar sources, such as stands
        of puriri, kowhai, fuchsia, rewarewa, flax, rata, pohutukawa, gums and banksias. In the breeding season, tui
        supplement their nectar diet with large invertebrates such as cicadas and stick insects obtained by hawking
        or by gleaning from the outside of trees. In the autumn, medium-sized fruit such as wineberry, kaikomako, mahoe,
        ngaio, rimu or kahikatea, make up much of the diet. In winter, flowering gums, banksias, puriri, and tree lucerne
        are important nectar sources, along with sugar-water feeders in gardens.

  <!-- Setting up more in depth detail in this ssection about the African Kudu  -->

  <section id="card2__info" class="container-fluid">
    <article class="row col-xl-12 wildlife the_kudu">
      <h1>Kudu - Africa</h1>
      <p class="wildlife_detail">
        <b>Identification</b><br><br>

        The kudus are two species of antelope of the genus Tragelaphus:

        Lesser kudu, Tragelaphus imberbis, of eastern Africa
        Greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, of eastern and southern Africa
        The two species of the Kudus look quite similar, though Greaters are larger than the lesser kudu. A large adult
        male Greater Kudu stands over 5 ft. tall, and a large male Lesser Kudu stand about 4 ft. tall. Both species have
        long horns, which point upward and slightly back, and curl in a corkscrew shape.

        <br><br><b>Distribution and habitat</b><br><br>

        Lesser kudus come from the savanna near Acacia and Commiphora shrubs. They have to rely on thickets for protection,
        so they are rarely seen in the open. Their brown and striped pelts help to camouflage them in scrub environments.

        <br><br><b>Behaviour and ecology</b><br><br>

        Like many other antelopes, male kudus can be found in bachelor groups, but they are more likely to be solitary.
        Their dominance displays tend not to last long and are generally fairly peaceful, consisting of one male making
        himself look big by making his hair stand on end. When males do have a face-off, they will lock their horns in a
        competition to determine the stronger puller; kudus' necks enlarge during the mating season for this reason.
        Sometimes two competing males are unable to unlock their horns and, if unable to disengage, will die of starvation
        or dehydration. Males are seen with females only in the mating season, when they join in groups of 5–15 kudus,
        including offspring. Calves grow very quickly and at six months are fairly independent of their mothers.

        A pregnant female will leave the herd to give birth to a single offspring. She will leave the newborn lying hidden
        for 4–5 weeks while coming back only to nurse it, which is the longest nursing period of any antelope species.
        Then the calf will start accompanying its mother for short periods. At 3 or months, the calf will be with its mother
        constantly, and at about six months they will rejoin the group.

        When threatened, kudu will often run away rather than fight. Wounded bulls have been known to charge an attacker,
        hitting the attacker with their sturdy horn base rather than stabbing it. Wounded females can keep running for many
        miles without stopping to rest for more than a minute. They are great kickers and are capable of breaking a wild dog's
        or jackal's neck or back. They are good jumpers and can clear a 5-foot fence from a standing start.

        <br><br><b>Food</b><br><br>

        Kudus are browsers and eat leaves and shoots. In dry seasons they eat wild watermelons and other fruit for their
        liquid content and the natural sugars that they provide. The lesser kudu is less dependent on water sources than
        the greater kudu.
